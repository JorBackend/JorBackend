## Scripting Examples
### Account Updater for MySql DB
```python
### Upload accounts to basic MySql server hosted on raspberryPi at SICTC
import pandas as pd
file = pd.read_csv("Accounts.csv",header=0, encoding="utf-8")

### NEED TO CLEAN THE DATA AND BE SURE ALL FILES HAVE APPORIATE DATA

queries=""
for i in range(0,len(file)):
    try:
        queryString = f"""
INSERT INTO Accounts
(Names,Address,City,State,Zip,Phone)
VALUES("{file['name'][i]}",
    "{file['address'][i]}",
    "{file['city'][i]}",
    "{file['state'][i]}",
    "{file['zip'][i]}",
    "{file['phone'][i]}");"""
        queries+=queryString+"\n"
    except:
        print(i)
        
with open("AccountsUpload.sql","w+", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    file.write(queries)    
```

### 2D Player Controller
```vb
'px and py stand for the location of the player right before it is moving and udlr represent up, down, left, and right. Whenever they are true it is moving them whichever direction 2 pixels on the timer 
 px = pnlPlayer.Location.X
 py = pnlPlayer.Location.Y

        If u = True Then
            pnlPlayer.Location = New Point(pnlPlayer.Location.X, pnlPlayer.Location.Y - 2)
        End If

        If d = True Then
            pnlPlayer.Location = New Point(pnlPlayer.Location.X, pnlPlayer.Location.Y + 2)
        End If

        If l = True Then
            pnlPlayer.Location = New Point(pnlPlayer.Location.X - 2, pnlPlayer.Location.Y)
        End If

        If r = True Then
            pnlPlayer.Location = New Point(pnlPlayer.Location.X + 2, pnlPlayer.Location.Y)
        End If
```
